# OS-WebServer
A simple multi-threaded webserver to illustrate the use of process scheduling and synchronisation and other OS concepts.

# Instructions to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run the `make` command.
3. If you got no compilation errors then you can run `./web_server`.
4. Go to `localhost:18000/index.html` to view the results.

# Changes to make while editing the codebase
1. Add the new file in `Makefile`, if any.
2. Keep standard libraries in `*.h` header files.
3. Use similar code format throughout the whole codebase (Use VS Code standard format support: `Ctrl + Shift + I`).
4. Use meaningful variable names.
5. Before pushing the code make sure your are on the upstream and avoid doing force push unless necessary.
6. Add executable files (like `web_server`) in `.gitignore`.
